Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Header.

0.07  Nov 12th, 2012
  - [DOCUMENTATION] add "tie() INTERFACE"

0.06  Nov 11th, 2012
  - First release

0.05  Nov 10th, 2012
  - add rehash() method which rebuilds header hash references

0.04  Nov 7th, 2012
  - reorganized tests using subtest() function exported by Test::More
  - doesn't overload '""' (stringify) with as_string()
    because this module isn't the replacement of CGI::header() function.
    I think CGI::header() should be used to stringify
    header hash references in most cases.
  - each() doesn't stringify values (cf. HTTP::Headers->scan),
    and so the callback function will receive raw CGI::Cookie objects.
  - On the other hand, flatten() forces stringification.
    flatten() may be called to generate PSGI-compatible header array
    references.
